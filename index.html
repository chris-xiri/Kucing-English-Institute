    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is now designed with a session-by-session tabbed navigation for a more granular, progressive learning path. This linear structure (Session 1 to 10) ensures the user follows the curriculum as intended. Within each session tab, all content for Pronunciation, Accent, Grammar, and Vocabulary is consolidated, followed by a new interactive quiz section. This design allows for focused learning and immediate application of knowledge, improving user understanding and retention. The quiz provides an interactive way to test concepts learned, making the overall experience more dynamic and effective. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The content is qualitative and instructional. The interactive "visualizations" are accordion cards for learning and a dynamic quiz for assessment. Goal: Organize & Inform -> Method: Accordion cards for exercises and a simple list for vocabulary. Justification: This organizes dense textual information into digestible, interactive chunks. Goal: Assess & Engage -> Method: An interactive quiz with multiple-choice questions. Interaction: Users click options to get immediate feedback. Justification: This provides a fun, low-pressure way to test retention and reinforce learning. All elements are built with HTML/CSS/JS. -->
